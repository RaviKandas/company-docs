# Company Values

Our values guide everything we do. They're not just words on a wall - they're how we work every day.

## 1. Customer Obsession

We start with the customer and work backwards. Every feature, every decision, every line of code should make our customers' lives better.

**In Practice:**
- Regular customer interviews
- Data-driven decision making
- Quick response to customer feedback
- Celebrating customer success stories

## 2. Radical Transparency

We believe in open communication, honest feedback, and sharing information broadly.

**In Practice:**
- All-hands meetings with Q&A
- Open salary bands
- Transparent roadmaps
- Direct feedback culture

## 3. Ownership Mentality

We act like owners, not renters. We take responsibility and think long-term.

**In Practice:**
- Autonomy in decision making
- Taking initiative without being asked
- Learning from failures
- Thinking beyond your immediate scope

## 4. Continuous Learning

We're always students. The moment we stop learning is the moment we stop growing.

**In Practice:**
- Learning budget for everyone
- Internal knowledge sharing
- Experimentation and iteration
- Celebrating lessons from failures

## 5. Work-Life Harmony

Great work comes from healthy, happy people. We work hard and live well.

**In Practice:**
- Flexible working hours
- Unlimited PTO (with minimums!)
- Mental health support
- No emails after 6pm or weekends

## Living Our Values

These values aren't just guidelines - they're commitments. We hire, promote, and recognize based on how well people embody these values.
