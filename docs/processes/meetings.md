# Meeting Guidelines

Meetings should be productive, not painful. Here's how we run effective meetings.

## Meeting Principles

1. **Meetings are expensive** - Respect everyone's time
2. **Async first** - Could this be a document?
3. **Agenda required** - No agenda, no meeting
4. **Outcomes focused** - Every meeting needs a clear outcome
5. **Document decisions** - If it's not written, it didn't happen

## Before the Meeting

### Do We Need This Meeting?

Ask yourself:
- Could this be an email/Slack message?
- Could this be a document with comments?
- Is everyone necessary?
- Is the timing right?
