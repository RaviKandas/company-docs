## Our Work Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Async First** - Default to asynchronous communication

3. **Iterate Quickly** - Ship small, ship often
4. **Feedback Culture** - Give and receive feedback regularly
5. **Trust by Default** - Assume positive intent

## Communication

| Quick Question | Slack | Needs response same day |
